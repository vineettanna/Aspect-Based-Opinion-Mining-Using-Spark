# Aspect-Based-Opinion-Mining-Using-Spark

### Objective of the Project

You own a restaurant, and you want good reviews, but what really matters? Answering this question that permeates the minds of restaurant owners everywhere, is exactly the goal of this project. **To accomplish this goal, we will use Topic Modeling (Latent Dirichlet Allocation or LDA) and sentiment analysis from Spark MLlib on 4.7M restaurant reviews from 12 metropolitan areas provided by Yelp.com**, to better understand key themes and sentiments that appear in reviews for restaurants across various cuisines.Then through a regression analysis, we aim to derive insights about what dining experience topics carry the most weight when explaining restaurant star rating reviews

### Dependencies

The project in this repository was successfully executed on Python 2.7 and Spark 1.6.
